# CTracker (ECCV2020 Spotlight)

Implementation in PyTorch of **Chained-Tracker** as described in [Chained-Tracker: Chaining Paired Attentive Regression Results for End-to-End Joint Multiple-Object Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14557).
 
The introduction video of CTracker is uploaded to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UovwAgKys88).

The codes is tested with PyTorch 0.4.1. It may not run with other versions.

## Installation
* Clone this repo into a directory named CTRACKER_ROOT
* Install the required packages
```
apt-get install tk-dev python-tk
```
* Install Python dependencies. We use python 3.6.5 and pytorch 0.4.1
```
conda create -n CTracker
conda activate CTracker
conda install pytorch=0.4.1 cuda90 -c pytorch
cd ${CTRACKER_ROOT}
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh lib/build.sh
```

## Organize MOT17 dataset
MOT17 dataset can be downloaded at [MOTChallenge](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT17Det/).

We uses two CSV files to organize the MOT17 dataset: one file containing annotations and one file containing a class name to ID mapping. 

We provide the two CSV files for MOT17 with codes in the CTRACKER_ROOT/data, you should copy them to MOT17_ROOT before starting training. 

### Dataset structures:
```
MOT17_ROOT/
        |->train/
        |    |->MOT17-02/
        |    |->MOT17-04/
        |    |->...
        |->test/
        |    |->MOT17-01/
        |    |->MOT17-03/
        |    |->...
        |->train_annots.csv
        |->train_labels.csv
```
MOT17_ROOT is your path of the MOT17 Dataset.


### Annotations format
The CSV file with annotations should contain one annotation per line.
Images with multiple bounding boxes should use one row per bounding box.
Note that indexing for pixel values starts at 0.
The expected format of each line is:
```
path/to/image.jpg,id,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
```

### Class mapping format
The class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line.
Each line should use the following format:
```
class_name,id
```

Indexing for classes starts at 0.
Do not include a background class as it is implicit.

For example:
```
person,0
dog,1
```

## Training

The network can be trained using the `train.py` script. For training on MOT17, use

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --root_path MOT17_ROOT --model_dir ./ctracker/ --depth 50
```
By default, testing will start immediately after training finished.

## Testing

A trained model is available at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5f-3QwcDoFL6b3_81tcsYTWsU43aBaz/view?usp=sharing)/[Tencent Weiyun](https://share.weiyun.com/KgWrWCv3), run the following commands to start testing:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py --dataset_path MOT17_ROOT --model_dir ./trained_model/
```
